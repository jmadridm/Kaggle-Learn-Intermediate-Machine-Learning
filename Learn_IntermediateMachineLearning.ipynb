In this micro-course, you will accelerate your machine learning expertise by learning how to:\n\n* tackle data types often found in real-world datasets (**missing values, categorical variables**),\n* design **pipelines** to improve the quality of your machine learning code,\n* use advanced techniques for model validation (**cross-validation**),\n* build state-of-the-art models that are widely used to win Kaggle competitions (**XGBoost**), and\n* avoid common and important data science mistakes (**leakage**).\n\nAlong the way, you'll cement your knowledge by completing in a hands-on exercise with real-world data for each new topic. The hands-on exercises use data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course), where you'll use 79 different explanatory variables (such as the type of roof, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms) to predict home prices. You'll measure your progress by submitting predictions to this competition and watching your position rise on [the leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/leaderboard)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6hNMveQ.png)\n\n## Prerequisites\nYou're ready for this micro-course if you've built a machine learning model before, and you're familiar with topics such as [model validation](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/model-validation), [underfitting and overfitting](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting), and [random forests](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests).\n\nIf you're completely new to machine learning, please check out our [introductory micro-course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning), which covers everything you need to prepare for this intermediate micro-course.\n\n## Your Turn\nContinue to the [first exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/3370272) to learn how to submit predictions to a Kaggle competition and determine what you might need to review before getting started.\n\n--- \n[Intermediate Machine Learning Home Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)\n\nHave questions or comments?

Then you'll compare the effectiveness of these approaches on a real-world dataset.\n\n## Introduction\nThere are many ways data can end up with missing values. For example,\n\n* A 2 bedroom house won't include a value for the size of a third bedroom.\n* A survey respondent may choose not to share his income.\n\nMost machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) give an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. So you'll need to choose one of the strategies below.\n\n## Three Approaches\n**1) A Simple Option: Drop Columns with Missing Values**\n\nThe simplest option is to drop columns with missing values.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sax80za.png)\n\nUnless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach. As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!\n\n**2) A Better Option: Imputation**\n\nImputation fills in the missing values with some number. For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4BpnlPA.png)\n\nThe imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.\n\n**3) An Extension To Imputation**\n\n**Imputation** is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UWOyg4a.png)\n\nIn this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.\n\nIn some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.\n\n## Example\nIn the example, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home). Our model will use information such as the number of rooms and land size to predict home price.\n\nWe won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv\")\n\n# Select target\ny = data.Price\n\n# To keep things simple. we'll use only numerical predictors\nmelb_predictors = data.drop(['Price'],axis=1) # Drop the column\nX = melb_predictors.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])\n\n# Divide data into training and validation subsets\nX_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)","execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Define Function to Measure Quality of Each Approach**\n\nWe define a function `score_dataset()` to compare different approaches to dealing with missing values.

In this case, the data is categorical, because responses fall into a fixed set of categories.\n* If people responded to a survey about which what brand of car they owned, the responses would fall into categories like \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", and \"Ford\". In this case, the data is also categorical.\n\nYou will get an error if you try to plug these variables into most machine learning models in Python without preprocessing them first. In this tutorial, we'll compare three approaches that you can use to prepare your categorical data.\n\n## Three Approaches\n1) Drop Categorical Variables\nThe easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.\n\n2) Label Encoding\n**Label encoding** assigns each unique value to a different integer.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tEogUAr.png)\n\nThis approach assumes an ordering of the categories: \"Never\" (0) < \"Rarely\" (1) < \"Most days\" (2) < \"Every day\" (3).\n\nThis assumption makes sense in this example, because there is an indisputable ranking to the categories. Not all categorical variables have a clear ordering in the values, but we refer to those that do as **ordinal variables**. For tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), you can expect label encoding to work well with ordinal variables.\n\n3) One-Hot Encoding\n**One-hot encoding** creates new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data. To understand this, we'll work through an example.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TW5m0aJ.png)\n\nIn the original dataset, \"Color\" is a categorical variable with three categories: \"Red\", \"Yellow\", and \"Green\". The corresponding one-hot encoding contains one column for each possible value, and one row for each row in the original dataset. Wherever the original value was \"Red\", we put a 1 in the \"Red\" column; if the original value was \"Yellow\", we put a 1 in the \"Yellow\" column, and so on.\n\nIn contrast to label encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories. Thus, you can expect this approach to work particularly well if there is no clear ordering in the categorical data (e.g., \"Red\" is neither more nor less than \"Yellow\"). We refer to categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking as **nominal variables**.\n\nOne-hot encoding generally does not perform well if the categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e., you generally won't use it for variables taking more than 15 different values).\n\n## Example\nAs in the previous tutorial, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home).\n\nWe won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and

Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n\nMany data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n\n1. **Cleaner Code:** Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy. With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n2. **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n3. **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n4. **More Options for Model Validation:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n\n## Example\nAs in the previous tutorial, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home)\n\nWe won't focus on the data loading step.

To see this, imagine you have a dataset with 5000 rows. You will typically keep about 20% of the data as a validation dataset, or 1000 rows. But this leaves some random chance in determining model scores. That is, a model might do well on one set of 1000 rows, even if it would be inaccurate on a different 1000 rows.\n\nAt an extreme, you could imagine having only 1 row of data in the validation set. If you compare alternative models, which one makes the best predictions on a single data point will be mostly a matter of luck!\n\nIn general, the larger the validation set, the less randomness (aka \"noise\") there is in our measure of model quality, and the more reliable it will be. Unfortunately, we can only get a large validation set by removing rows from our training data, and smaller training datasets mean worse models!\n\n## What is cross-validation?\nIn **cross-validation**, we run our modeling process on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.\n\nFor example, we could begin by dividing the data into 5 pieces, each 20% of the full dataset. In this case, we say that we have broken the data into 5 \"**folds**\".\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9k60cVA.png)\n\nThen, we run one experiment for each fold:\n\n* In **Experiment 1**, we use the first fold as a validation (or holdout) set and everything else as training data. This gives us a measure of model quality based on a 20% holdout set.\n* In **Experiment 2**, we hold out data from the second fold (and use everything except the second fold for training the model). The holdout set is then used to get a second estimate of model quality.\n* We repeat this process, using every fold once as the holdout set. Putting this together, 100% of the data is used as holdout at some point, and we end up with a measure of model quality that is based on all of the rows in the dataset (even if we don't use all rows simultaneously).\n\n## When should you use cross-validation?\nCross-validation gives a more accurate measure of model quality, which is especially important if you are making a lot of modeling decisions. However, it can take longer to run, because it estimates multiple models (one for each fold).\n\nSo, given these tradeoffs, when should you use each approach?\n\n* For small datasets, where extra computational burden isn't a big deal, you should run cross-validation.\n* For larger datasets, a single validation set is sufficient. Your code will run faster, and you may have enough data that there's little need to re-use some of it for holdout.\n\nThere's no simple threshold for what constitutes a large vs. small dataset. But if your model takes a couple minutes or less to run, it's probably worth switching to cross-validation.\n\nAlternatively, you can run cross-validation and see if the scores for each experiment seem close. If each experiment yields the same results, a single validation set is probably sufficient.\n\n## Example\nWe'll work with the same data as in the previous tutorial.

This method dominates many Kaggle competitions and achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.\n\n## Introduction\nFor much of this course, you have made predictions with the random forest method, which achieves better performance than a single decision tree simply by averaging the predictions of many decision trees.\n\nWe refer to the random forest method as an \"ensemble method\". By definition, **ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).\n\nNext, we'll learn about another ensemble method called gradient boosting.\n\n## Gradient Boosting\n**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.\n\nIt begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n\nThen, we start the cycle:\n\n* First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\n* These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), for instance).\n* Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (_Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model._)\n* Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n* ... repeat!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MvCGENh.png)\n\n## Example\nWe begin by loading the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Read the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv')\n\n# Select subset of predictors\ncols_to_use = ['Rooms', 'Distance', 'Landsize', 'BuildingArea', 'YearBuilt']\nX = data[cols_to_use]\n\n# Select target\ny = data.Price\n\n# Separate data into training and validation sets\nX_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y)","execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this example, you'll work with the XGBoost library. **XGBoost** stands for **extreme gradient boosting**, which is an implementation of gradient boosting with several additional features focused on performance and speed.

If you don't know how to prevent it, leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in subtle and dangerous ways. So, this is one of the most important concepts for practicing data scientists.\n\n## Introduction\n**Data leakage** (or **leakage**) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n\nIn other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.\n\nThere are two main types of leakage: **target leakage** and **train-test contamination**.\n\n### Target leakage\n**Target leakage** occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n\nAn example will be helpful. Imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data look like this:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n      <tr>\n          <td>got_pneumonia</td>\n          <td>age</td>\n          <td>weight</td>\n          <td>male</td>\n          <td>took_antibiotic_medicine</td>\n          <td>...</td>\n      </tr>\n  </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>False</td>\n          <td>65</td>\n          <td>100</td>\n          <td>False</td>\n          <td>False</td>\n          <td>...</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>False</td>\n          <td>72</td>\n          <td>130</td>\n          <td>True</td>\n          <td>False</td>\n          <td>...</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>True</td>\n          <td>58</td>\n          <td>100</td>\n          <td>False</td>\n          <td>True</td>\n          <td>...</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns, but `took_antibiotic_medicine` is frequently changed after the value for `got_pneumonia` is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of `False` for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.\n\nBut the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y7hfTYe.png)\n\n### Train-Test Contamination\nA different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.\n\nRecall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called **train-test contamination**.\n\nFor example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling `train_test_split()`. The end result? Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n\nAfter all, you incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when you do more complex feature engineering.\n\nIf your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!\n\n## Example\nIn this example, you will learn one way to detect and remove target leakage.\n\nWe will use a dataset about credit card applications and skip the basic data set-up code.

The variables **`active`** and **`majorcards`** are a little less clear, but from the description, they sound concerning.

Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.\n\n## What's next?\nThis may still seem abstract.
